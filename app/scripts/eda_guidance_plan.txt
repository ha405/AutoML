*   **Overall Goal:** Analyze the initial data to understand its characteristics and prepare it for the likely ML task identified below. The aim is to produce a cleaned dataset (`processed_dataset.csv`) suitable for modeling.
*   **1. Initial ML Task Assessment:**
    *   The most probable ML task is **Regression**. The business problem is to *estimate car prices*, making it a prediction of a continuous numerical value.
    *   The most likely target variable column name is `price`. Its apparent data type is `float64`.
*   **2. Target Variable Investigation:**
    *   **Guidance for EDA:**
        *   Confirm the presence of the `price` column and that its data type is indeed `float64`. No type conversions are expected at this stage.
        *   Analyze the distribution of `price`. Examine its skewness. If significantly skewed, consider a transformation (e.g., log transformation) to improve model performance. Visualize the distribution using a histogram or kernel density plot and report skewness.
*   **3. Feature Exploration & Refinement:**
    *   **Guidance for EDA:**
        *   `car_ID` appears to be a unique identifier and is likely irrelevant for prediction. Consider dropping it.
        *   The `CompanyName` column requires careful examination. Identify how many unique company names exist and whether there are any misspellings or variations that need to be corrected to consolidate categories.
        *   Categorical features that are currently encoded as boolean (`fueltype_gas`, `aspiration_turbo`, etc.) are already in a suitable format. However, it would be important to verify that no unexpected values are present other than boolean.
        *   Assess collinearity between numerical features like `wheelbase`, `carlength`, `carwidth`, `carheight`, `curbweight`, and `enginesize`. High correlation can lead to instability in some models. Report any high correlations (&gt;0.7 or &lt;-0.7).
        *   Investigate the relationship between each numerical feature and the `price` variable. Scatter plots can be useful for visualizing these relationships.
*   **4. Data Quality & Cleaning:**
    *   **Guidance for EDA:**
        *   The provided dataset details indicate no missing values. However, it's important to explicitly confirm this during the EDA process.
        *   Check for outliers in numerical features. Box plots can be helpful. Decide on a strategy to handle outliers (e.g., trimming, capping, transformation).
*   **5. Feature Representation:**
    *   **Guidance for EDA:**
        *   The features that are already encoded as booleans don't require additional handling in terms of their representation.
        *   Consider scaling numerical features using `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler`. This is generally recommended for many ML algorithms.
*   **6. Desired State of Output Dataset (`processed_dataset.csv`):**
    *   **Guidance for EDA:** The goal is to save a CSV named `processed_dataset.csv` where:
        *   Columns represent the final selected/engineered features and the target variable (`price`).
        *   All data is numerical (including encoded categoricals).
        *   `car_ID` has been removed.
        *   Inconsistencies in `CompanyName` are resolved.
        *   Outliers are handled.
        *   Features are scaled.
