**EDA Summary**
The EDA process resulted in a final dataset shape of (205, 36) after handling missing values, dropping duplicates, and preprocessing categorical features. Missing values were handled by imputing median values for numeric columns and most frequent values for categorical columns. Categorical features were encoded using LabelEncoder for binary variables and OneHotEncoder for variables with fewer than 10 unique values. The columns 'cylindernumber', 'carwidth', 'price', and 'car_ID' were dropped due to high cardinality or redundancy. A new feature 'power_per_volume' was engineered by dividing 'horsepower' by 'enginesize'.

**Target Variable**
The target variable is 'price'.

**ML Task Type**
The primary task is Regression, as the target variable 'price' is a continuous variable.

**Recommended Model Types**
1. **Linear Regression (baseline)**: A simple and interpretable model that can serve as a baseline for comparison with more complex models.
2. **Random Forest Regressor (handles non-linearity)**: Can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, and is robust to outliers.
3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor (potential high accuracy)**: Can handle complex interactions between features and is known for its high accuracy in regression tasks.

**Next Step Considerations**
* Ensure scaling is applied consistently to all features to prevent feature dominance.
* Pay attention to the 'power_per_volume' feature, which may be an important predictor of the target variable.
* Consider using techniques such as feature selection or dimensionality reduction to reduce the impact of high cardinality features.
