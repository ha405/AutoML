**EDA Summary**
Unfortunately, due to the errors in the input context, it is not possible to summarize the key outcomes reported in the `<eda_execution_output_logs>`. The logs are unreadable, and the script execution failed due to a file preprocessing error.

**Target Variable**
Based on the `<business_problem>` and column names in `<initial_dataset_details>` or `<eda_execution_output_logs>`, it is not possible to identify the most likely target variable for the ML model.

**ML Task Type**
Due to the lack of information, it is not possible to determine the ML task type (Classification or Regression).

**Recommended Model Types**
Not applicable due to the lack of information.

**Next Step Considerations**
To proceed with the ML pipeline generation, it is essential to:

* Resolve the file preprocessing error and re-run the EDA script to obtain meaningful logs.
* Review the EDA logs to identify the target variable, handle missing values, encode categorical features, and perform feature engineering as necessary.
* Determine the ML task type based on the target variable and business problem.
* Select suitable ML models based on the task type, data characteristics, and business problem.
