### ML Plan

*1. EDA Summary & Key Findings (Log-Driven):*
The final dimensions of the data after EDA are not explicitly stated in the logs. However, we can infer that the data has been processed and cleaned. The logs confirm that duplicate rows were dropped, and missing values were handled using median imputation for numeric columns and most frequent imputation for categorical columns. The logs also indicate that columns with excessive missing values (> 30%) were dropped. The final missing value status is that no missing values remain. The logs confirm that categorical columns were encoded using LabelEncoder, OrdinalEncoder, or OneHotEncoder. No errors or warnings were reported in the stderr section of the logs.

*2. Target Variable Identification:*
Based on the business problem and confirmed by reviewing the EDA execution logs, the target variable (y) is identified as the "price" column. Its data type after EDA preprocessing is assumed to be continuous (numeric).

*3. ML Task Type:*
Based on the target variable's nature (continuous) and the business problem, the ML task is identified as a Regression task.

*4. Feature Set for Modeling:*
The feature set (X) available for modeling after the EDA script's execution includes all columns except those dropped during EDA, such as columns with excessive missing values, duplicate columns, and columns with high cardinality. The exact column names are not explicitly stated in the logs, but we can infer that they include features like engine size, safety rating, fuel efficiency, brand, and others.

*5. Recommended Modeling Approach:*
*Baselines:* DummyRegressor, LinearRegression
*Primary Candidates:* RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, SVR (Justification: "Tree ensembles for potential non-linearities", "Regularized linear models if high dimensionality")

*6. Evaluation Strategy:*
*Primary Metric:* R-squared (R2) to explain variance
*Secondary Metrics:* Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
*Validation:* K-Fold Cross-Validation (e.g., 5 or 10 folds) on the training set for comparing the recommended models robustly.

*7. Critical Next Step Considerations & Potential Issues (Log-Driven):*
*Data Size:* Although not explicitly stated, the dataset size might be small for complex models; emphasize robust CV.
*Feature Scaling:* Ensure any new data follows the same scaling as the EDA script used median imputation for numeric columns.
*Encoding:* Note the potential increase in dimensionality due to OneHotEncoding of categorical features.
*High Cardinality:* Verify from logs if any high-cardinality features remain unexpectedly.
*Feature Engineering:* Explore feature interactions/ratios if baseline models perform poorly.
