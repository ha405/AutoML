*   **1. Anticipated ML Task & Target:**
    *   The ML task is Regression.
    *   The target variable is `price`.
*   **2. Potential Feature Set:**
    *   Expect scaled versions of original numerical features like `wheelbase`, `carlength`, `carwidth`, `carheight`, `curbweight`, `enginesize`, `boreratio`, `stroke`, `compressionratio`, `horsepower`, `peakrpm`, `citympg`, and `highwaympg`.
    *   Boolean (0/1) features representing `fueltype_gas`, `aspiration_turbo`, etc.
    *   A cleaned and potentially encoded `CompanyName` feature, if the EDA reveals valuable company-specific effects.
*   **3. Modeling Strategy:**
    *   **Baseline Model(s):** Linear Regression or Dummy Regressor. These provide a simple benchmark.
    *   **Candidate Model(s):**
        *   RandomForestRegressor: Robust to outliers and can capture non-linear relationships.
        *   GradientBoostingRegressor (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM): Often provides high accuracy and handles mixed data types well.
*   **4. Evaluation Approach:**
    *   **Primary Metric:** Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). It penalizes larger errors more heavily and is easily interpretable in the original price units.
    *   **Secondary Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE) provides a less penalized view of average error. R-squared explains the variance in target variable explained by the model.
    *   **Validation:** k-fold Cross-Validation (e.g., k=5 or 10) to get a reliable estimate of model performance on unseen data.
*   **5. Further Modeling Considerations:**
    *   Hyperparameter tuning for chosen models (e.g., using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV).
    *   Feature importance analysis to understand which features are most influential in predicting car prices.
    *   Iterate on feature engineering based on model performance and feature importance results. Consider interactions between features.
