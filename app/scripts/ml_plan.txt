*   **1. Anticipated ML Task & Target:**
    *   Reiterate the ML Task identified in Part 1.
        *   **ML Task:** Regression
    *   Confirm the expected target variable column name in `processed_dataset.csv`.
        *   **Target Variable:** `sales_volume`
*   **2. Potential Feature Set:**
    *   Describe the types of features expected in `processed_dataset.csv` (e.g., original numerical scaled, OHE features, engineered date features). Exact names depend on EDA execution, but list key original columns likely to be included in some form.
        *   Scaled numerical features (`month`, `day_of_week`, `day_of_year`, `hour_of_day`). One-Hot Encoded features for `coffee_name`. Potentially the `cash_type_cash` as is, or after conversion to numerical 0 or 1.
*   **3. Modeling Strategy:**
    *   **Baseline Model(s):** Suggest simple baselines for comparison (e.g., Logistic Regression/Dummy Classifier for classification, Linear Regression/Dummy Regressor for regression).
        *   **Baseline:** Linear Regression or a `DummyRegressor` (predicting the mean or median `sales_volume`).
    *   **Candidate Model(s):** Recommend 1-2 potentially stronger models based on the task (e.g., RandomForest, GradientBoosting, LightGBM). Briefly mention why they might be suitable.
        *   **Candidate Models:** Random Forest Regressor or Gradient Boosting Regressor (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM). These models can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
*   **4. Evaluation Approach:**
    *   **Primary Metric:** Recommend a primary metric aligned with the business goal (e.g., F1-score, Accuracy, RMSE, MAE). Justify the recommendation.
        *   **Primary Metric:** Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). It penalizes larger errors more heavily and is easily interpretable in the original unit of `sales_volume`.
    *   **Secondary Metrics:** Suggest other metrics to provide a more complete picture.
        *   **Secondary Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for a more robust measure of average error, and R-squared to understand the proportion of variance explained by the model.
    *   **Validation:** Recommend a robust validation strategy (e.g., k-fold Cross-Validation, StratifiedKFold).
        *   **Validation:** k-fold Cross-Validation (e.g., k=5 or 10) to get a robust estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.
*   **5. Further Modeling Considerations:**
    *   Highlight key activities for the modeling phase itself, such as hyperparameter tuning, feature importance analysis, and iterating on feature engineering based on model insights.
        *   Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model performance. Feature importance analysis to understand which features are most influential in predicting `sales_volume`.
*   **6. Visualization Prompts:**
    *   Suggest simple, non-technical graph prompts to help explain model results and data relationships, for example:
        *   "Create a scatter plot of predicted `sales_volume` versus actual `sales_volume`. Ideally, the points should be close to a diagonal line."
        *   "Show a bar chart of feature importances from the Random Forest model. This helps understand which factors are most driving sales volume."
        *   "Display a line graph of actual versus predicted `sales_volume` over time."
