*   **1. Anticipated ML Task & Target:**
    *   Reiterate the ML Task identified in Part 1.
        *   Regression.
    *   Confirm the expected target variable column name in `processed_dataset.csv`.
        *   `price`
*   **2. Potential Feature Set:**
    *   Describe the types of features expected in `processed_dataset.csv` (e.g., original numerical scaled, OHE features, engineered date features). Exact names depend on EDA execution, but list key original columns likely to be included in some form.
        *   Scaled original numerical features (e.g., `wheelbase`, `carlength`, `carwidth`, `curbweight`, `enginesize`, `boreratio`, `stroke`, `compressionratio`, `horsepower`, `peakrpm`, `citympg`, `highwaympg`).
        *   One-Hot Encoded categorical features (e.g., from `fueltype`, `aspiration`, `doornumber`, `enginelocation`).
        *   Potentially Frequency/Target Encoded categorical features (e.g., from `enginetype`, `fuelsystem`, `carbody`, `drivewheel`, `cylindernumber`).
        *   Company Name boolean variables after correction.
*   **3. Modeling Strategy:**
    *   **Baseline Model(s):** Suggest simple baselines for comparison (e.g., Logistic Regression/Dummy Classifier for classification, Linear Regression/Dummy Regressor for regression).
        *   Linear Regression or Dummy Regressor.
    *   **Candidate Model(s):** Recommend 1-2 potentially stronger models based on the task (e.g., RandomForest, GradientBoosting, LightGBM). Briefly mention why they might be suitable.
        *   RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor are suitable choices due to their ability to capture non-linear relationships and handle feature interactions.
*   **4. Evaluation Approach:**
    *   **Primary Metric:** Recommend a primary metric aligned with the business goal (e.g., F1-score, Accuracy, RMSE, MAE). Justify the recommendation.
        *   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is recommended as the primary metric. It penalizes larger errors more heavily and provides a good measure of the model's prediction accuracy in the original unit of the target variable (price).
    *   **Secondary Metrics:** Suggest other metrics to provide a more complete picture.
        *   Mean Absolute Error (MAE) provides the average magnitude of errors.
        *   R-squared (Coefficient of Determination) indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model.
    *   **Validation:** Recommend a robust validation strategy (e.g., k-fold Cross-Validation, StratifiedKFold).
        *   K-fold Cross-Validation (e.g., with k=5 or 10) is recommended to assess the model's generalization performance.
*   **5. Further Modeling Considerations:**
    *   Highlight key activities for the modeling phase itself, such as hyperparameter tuning, feature importance analysis, and iterating on feature engineering based on model insights.
        *   Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
        *   Analyze feature importance to understand which features are most influential in predicting car prices. This can provide valuable insights for optimizing car design and marketing strategies.
        *   Iterate on feature engineering based on model performance and feature importance analysis to improve model accuracy.
