**SME Visualization Plan: Car Price Prediction**

1.  **Overall Goal (Business Focus):**
    To illustrate typical car prices, show price relationships with key features, identify main price drivers, and assess the prediction model's reliability for strategic decisions.

### Chart 1: Histogram - Distribution of Car Prices

*   **Type:** Histogram
*   **Business Insight:** Understanding the typical range and frequency of car prices in the dataset.
*   **Business Value:** Sets a baseline understanding of the car price market and what the model is predicting.
*   **Data Source:** 'price' column from the processed data (Input_processed.csv), as confirmed by the EDA.
*   **Clarity Tip:** Title: "Distribution of Car Prices"; Annotate with average price (approximately 13276.71 based on EDA summary statistics) and median price (approximately 10295 based on EDA summary statistics).  Use a bin size that clearly shows the distribution.

### Chart 2: Scatter Plot - Car Price Relationship with Engine Size

*   **Type:** Scatter Plot
*   **Business Insight:** Visualizing the relationship between car price and engine size, the most influential continuous feature.
*   **Business Value:** Shows how engine size directly impacts car price, informing decisions about engine design and marketing.
*   **Data Source:** 'price' and 'enginesize' columns from the processed data (Input_processed.csv). Engine size is identified as the most important feature in the ML output logs.
*   **Clarity Tip:** Title: "Car Price Relationship with Engine Size"; X-axis: Engine Size; Y-axis: Car Price. Add a trend line to highlight the relationship.

### Chart 3: Bar Chart (Horizontal) - Key Factors Influencing Car Price

*   **Type:** Bar Chart (Horizontal Recommended)
*   **Business Insight:** Ranking the factors identified by the ML model as most impactful on car price.
*   **Business Value:** Pinpoints features management can potentially manipulate or focus on to influence car prices.
*   **Data Source:** Feature importances extracted from the ML output logs. The top 10 features and their importances are: enginesize (0.556499), curbweight (0.290503), highwaympg (0.045915), horsepower (0.028998), carwidth (0.012793), carlength (0.007734), CompanyName_bmw (0.007383), wheelbase (0.007022), citympg (0.006317), peakrpm (0.005270).
*   **Clarity Tip:** Title: "Key Factors Influencing Car Price"; X-axis: Feature Importance; Y-axis: Feature Name. Highlight the top 2-3 features (enginesize, curbweight, highwaympg) with a different color or annotation.

### Chart 4: Scatter Plot - Model Prediction Accuracy: Actual vs. Predicted Car Price

*   **Type:** Scatter Plot
*   **Business Insight:** Assessing the overall accuracy and reliability of the ML model's predictions.
*   **Business Value:** Builds confidence (or flags issues) in using the model for car price estimations.
*   **Data Source:** Actual car prices (y_test) vs. Predicted car prices (y_pred) from the ML output logs. R-squared value from the logs: 0.9569.
*   **Clarity Tip:** Title: "Model Prediction Accuracy: Actual vs. Predicted Car Price"; X-axis: Actual Car Price; Y-axis: Predicted Car Price. Annotate with R-squared = 0.9569. Add a y=x reference line to easily visualize prediction accuracy.

### Chart 5: Histogram - Typical Range of Prediction Error

*   **Type:** Histogram
*   **Business Insight:** Understanding the typical size and distribution of prediction errors (residuals).
*   **Business Value:** Quantifies the model's uncertainty, helping managers understand the likely +/- range for predictions.
*   **Data Source:** Residuals (Actual Price - Predicted Price).  MAE from the ML output logs: 1288.2720.
*   **Clarity Tip:** Title: "Typical Range of Prediction Error"; X-axis: Prediction Error (Residual); Y-axis: Frequency. Annotate with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 1288.27. Center the histogram around zero.
