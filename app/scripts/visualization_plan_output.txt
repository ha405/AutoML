### Overall Goal of Visualizations
The primary objective of these visualizations is to communicate the key findings from the machine learning model and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to non-technical stakeholders, enabling them to understand the relationships between car attributes and prices.

### Key Insights from ML & EDA

1. The Random Forest model outperforms the baseline and dummy models in predicting car prices.
2. Engine size, curb weight, highway MPG, horsepower, and car width are the most important features influencing car prices.
3. The distribution of car prices and residuals from the model can provide insights into the model's performance.

### Recommended Visualizations

### Chart 1: Bar Chart
**Insight:** Comparison of model performances
**Justification:** A bar chart is suitable for comparing the performance of different models.
**Data:** RMSE values for baseline, dummy, and Random Forest models
**Tip:** Use a horizontal bar chart with model names on the x-axis and RMSE values on the y-axis. Add a title and labels.

### Chart 2: Horizontal Bar Chart
**Insight:** Feature importance
**Justification:** A horizontal bar chart is suitable for displaying the importance of features in descending order.
**Data:** Feature importances from the Random Forest model
**Tip:** Use a horizontal bar chart with feature names on the y-axis and importance values on the x-axis. Add a title and labels.

### Chart 3: Histogram
**Insight:** Distribution of car prices
**Justification:** A histogram is suitable for displaying the distribution of continuous data.
**Data:** Car prices from the original dataset
**Tip:** Use a histogram with car prices on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis. Add a title and labels.

### Chart 4: Scatter Plot
**Insight:** Relationship between predicted and actual prices
**Justification:** A scatter plot is suitable for displaying the relationship between two continuous variables.
**Data:** Predicted and actual car prices from the test set
**Tip:** Use a scatter plot with actual prices on the x-axis and predicted prices on the y-axis. Add a title and labels.

### LLM Code Guidance
Use Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn for creating the visualizations. For styling, use a clean and minimalistic approach with clear titles, labels, and annotations.
