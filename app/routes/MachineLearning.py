You are an expert AI/ML engineer and Python programmer specializing in generating end-to-end machine learning pipelines.
Your goal is to create a complete, clean, robust, and executable Python script based on the provided context.

Note: The code should literally start off with the import statements. Don't include any introduction like "Here is the corrected script". 

**Input Context:**

<file_path>
{file_path_str}
</file_path>

<business_problem>
{business_problem_str}
</business_problem>

**Instructions for Python Script Generation:**

Generate a Python script that performs the following steps IN ORDER:

1.  **Imports:** Import necessary libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn.model_selection` (train_test_split, KFold, cross_val_score), `sklearn.preprocessing` (StandardScaler, LabelEncoder - if needed), relevant `sklearn.linear_model`, `sklearn.tree`, `sklearn.ensemble`, `sklearn.svm`, `sklearn.neural_network` models, and `sklearn.metrics`. Import `shap` if you plan to use it.
2.  **Load Data:**
    *   Load the CSV file from the path specified in `<file_path>`. Use `pd.read_csv(r"{file_path_str}")`.
    *   Handle potential `FileNotFoundError` with a clear error message and exit.
    *   Create a copy: `df = df_original.copy()`.
3.  **Initial Data Preparation (Minimal):**
    *   Identify the likely target variable based on the `<business_problem>` (e.g., 'price', 'churn', 'sales'). Print the identified target column name. If unsure, make a reasonable guess and print it.
    *   Handle obvious non-feature columns (e.g., drop unique ID columns if present and not the target).
    *   Perform basic missing value imputation (e.g., median for numeric, mode for categorical) ONLY IF ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY before determining task type. Prefer handling missing values *after* train/test split if possible, using fit on train data only. *For simplicity here, let's allow basic imputation before split if needed for target identification.*
4.  **Infer Task Type & Prepare Target:**
    *   Examine the identified target column:
        *   If dtype is 'object' or has few unique numeric values (e.g., <= 10), assume **Classification**. If target is object/categorical, use `LabelEncoder` to convert it to numeric BEFORE splitting.
        *   Otherwise, assume **Regression**.
    *   Print the inferred task type ("Classification" or "Regression").
    *   Define features `X` (all columns except target) and target `y`. Ensure `y` is numeric.
5.  **Train-Test Split:**
    *   Split `X` and `y` into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split, `random_state=42`).
6.  **Preprocessing Pipeline (Fit on Train, Transform Both):**
    *   Identify numeric and categorical features in `X_train`.
    *   Create a `ColumnTransformer` pipeline:
        *   For numeric features: Use `StandardScaler()`. Handle missing values *within the pipeline* using `SimpleImputer(strategy='median')` before scaling.
        *   For categorical features: Handle missing values *within the pipeline* using `SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')` then apply `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse_output=False)`.
    *   Fit the transformer ONLY on `X_train`.
    *   Transform both `X_train` and `X_test`. Store the processed data (it might be numpy arrays). Get feature names after transformation if possible (using `get_feature_names_out`).
7.  **Model Selection:**
    *   Based on the inferred task type, select **at least 3 appropriate models**:
        *   *If Classification:* e.g., `LogisticRegression`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `RandomForestClassifier`.
        *   *If Regression:* e.g., `LinearRegression`, `DecisionTreeRegressor`, `RandomForestRegressor`.
    *   Instantiate the selected models (use default hyperparameters or common settings like `random_state=42`).
8.  **Model Training and Evaluation (using Cross-Validation on Training Data):**
    *   Define `KFold` (e.g., `n_splits=5`, `shuffle=True`, `random_state=42`).
    *   For each selected model:
        *   Perform cross-validation using `cross_val_score` on the *preprocessed training data* (`X_train_processed`, `y_train`).
        *   Use appropriate scoring metric(s) based on task type:
            *   *If Classification:* `'accuracy'`, `'f1_macro'`
            *   *If Regression:* `'neg_mean_squared_error'`, `'r2'`
        *   Calculate and print the mean and standard deviation of the cross-validation scores for each metric.
9.  **Final Model Training and Test Set Evaluation:**
    *   Choose the best model based on cross-validation results (e.g., highest mean F1/Accuracy or R2/lowest MSE). State which model was chosen.
    *   Train the chosen best model on the *entire preprocessed training set* (`X_train_processed`, `y_train`).
    *   Make predictions on the *preprocessed test set* (`X_test_processed`).
    *   Calculate and print the final evaluation metrics on the test set predictions:
        *   *If Classification:* `accuracy_score`, `classification_report` (includes precision, recall, f1-score).
        *   *If Regression:* `mean_absolute_error`, `mean_squared_error`, `r2_score`.
10. **Feature Importance / Interpretation (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   If the best model has `feature_importances_` (like RandomForest), print the top 10 feature importances with their names (use names obtained from the preprocessor).
    *   *Advanced (Optional):* If `shap` is imported and the model is suitable (e.g., tree-based), calculate and print SHAP summary plot information (this might be complex to generate code for reliably, focus on `feature_importances_` first).
11. The code shouldnt contain anything like "Here is corrected code". It should ONLY contain code, no comments, nothing else. just python code
12. It shouldn't contain any introductory or concluding remarks about code either as no text is needed.
13. The code should literally start off with the import statements. Don't include any introduction like "Here is the corrected script". Omit any starting text please.

**Output Format:**
*   Your response MUST contain ONLY the raw Python code for the script.
*   Do NOT include any markdown formatting (like ```python ... ```).
*   Do NOT include any comments in the final code, unless explicitly needed (e.g., target variable guess).
*   The script must be fully executable if the `<file_path>` is valid and the necessary libraries are installed.
*   Include necessary imports at the beginning.

VERY IMPORTANT: The code shouldnt contain anything like "Here is corrected code" in starting. It should ONLY contain code, no comments, nothing else. just python code
AND: It shouldn't contain any introductory or concluding remarks about code either as no text is needed. ONLY RAW PYTHON CODE

The code should literally start off with the import statements. Don't include any introduction like "Here is the corrected script"

SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION_ML_REFLECTOR_TEMPLATE = r"""
You are an expert Python code reviewer and AI/ML Quality Assurance specialist.
Your task is to meticulously review the provided Python script intended for building a machine learning pipeline.

**Context:**
The script was generated based on the following requirements summarized below:
<requirements_summary>
{requirements_summary}
</requirements_summary>

**Provided Script:**
<script>
{generated_code}
</script>

**Review Criteria:**

1.  **Correctness & Logic:**
    *   Does the code run without syntax errors?
    *   Is the file loaded correctly using the specified path (`{file_path_str}`)? Is `FileNotFoundError` handled?
    *   Is the task type (Classification/Regression) inferred correctly based on the likely target variable?
    *   Is the target variable prepared correctly (e.g., LabelEncoded if needed)?
    *   Is the train-test split performed correctly?
    *   Is the preprocessing pipeline (imputation, scaling, encoding) structured correctly using `ColumnTransformer`? Is it fitted ONLY on training data and used to transform both train and test sets?
    *   Are the selected models appropriate for the inferred task type?
    *   Is cross-validation performed correctly on the training set *after* preprocessing? Are appropriate scoring metrics used?
    *   Is the final model trained on the full (preprocessed) training set and evaluated on the (preprocessed) test set? Are appropriate final metrics calculated and printed?
    *   Is feature importance calculated correctly if applicable?
2.  **Completeness:**
    *   Does the script include all necessary imports?
    *   Are all major steps present (Load, Prep, Infer Task, Split, Preprocess, Select Models, CV Eval, Final Eval, Importance)?
    *   Are all specified print statements included (e.g., shape, target, task type, CV scores, final metrics)?
3.  **Adherence:**
    *   Does the script strictly follow the output format (only raw Python code)?
    *   Are there any unnecessary comments or markdown?
    *   Are only the allowed libraries imported?
4.  **Robustness:**
    *   Is the logic sound (e.g., avoiding data leakage between train/test sets during preprocessing)?
5.  **Others:**
    *   The code doesn't need to cater to error handling or data cleaning tasks.
6. The code shouldnt contain anything like "Here is corrected code". It should ONLY contain code, no comments, nothing else. just python code
7. It shouldn't contain any introductory or concluding remarks about code either as no text is needed.
8. Don't be critical for no accurate reason. If it does everything correctly, response ONLY with <OK>, NOTHING ELSE

Note: The code should literally start off with the import statements. Don't include any introduction like "Here is the corrected script". 

**Output:**
*   If the script meets all criteria, appears logically sound, and is likely to run correctly, respond ONLY with: `<OK>`
Note: The code should literally start off with the import statements. Don't include any introduction like "Here is the corrected script". 
*   Otherwise, provide concise, constructive feedback listing the specific issues found and suggest exact corrections needed. Be specific (e.g., "Line 45: Preprocessing pipeline should be fitted only on X_train, not the whole X."). Do NOT provide the fully corrected code, only the feedback/corrections list. Start feedback with "Issues found:".
